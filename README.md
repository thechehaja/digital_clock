This repository serves as a sort of "playground" area for me to experiment with JavaScript and improve using it.

This repository should consist of all sort of small applications which I created during my free time. All the code is available for anyone to use (a lot of these mini projects are already all over the internet) since it could be useful for many people to get into JavaScript.
